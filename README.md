After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

tagrity config to use (default to ~/.config/tagrity/config.yml if available).
A config file is a yaml file with the following possible values.
Some of these can be overridden with options, however the configfile
provided via --configfile will override the global config file in
~/.config/tagrity/config.yml
```
# ext_cmds allows different tag generators to be used depending on the file extension.
# Multiple extensions does not work, *.html.erb files will be picked up as erb.
# ext_cmds:
#   <file extension>: <command to use to generate tags for this file extension>
# DEFAULT: empty
ext_cmds:
  rb: ripper-tags
  c: ctags
  go: gotags

# default_cmd specifies the default command to be used to generate tags
# default_cmd: <command>
# DEFAULT: ctags
default_cmd: ctags

# tagf is the filename (relative) to generate tags into
# tagf: <filename>
# DEFAULT: tags
tagf: tags

# excluded_exts specifies which file extensions to not generate tags for.
# excluded_exts: [<file extension>, ...]
# DEFAULT: []
excluded_exts: [rb, h, js]

# excluded_paths specifies which paths to ignore.
# It's usually better to avoid this since by default tagrity will only look
# at files which are tracked by git.
# excluded_paths: [<path>, ...]
# DEFAULT: []
excluded_paths: [vendor, node_modules]
